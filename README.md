# **Don & Associates Cloud Expansion & Vendor Analysis**

This project evaluates cloud technologies to support Don & Associates’ regional expansion into the Northeast. The analysis examines traditional infrastructure challenges, compares major cloud providers, and recommends the most effective cloud platform to support growth, scalability, and operational efficiency.

---

## **📌 Project Summary**

As Don & Associates expands across state lines, the company faces increased demands for reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient technology infrastructure. Traditional on-premises systems require physical servers, long deployment times, increased staffing, and high upfront costs challenges that slow growth and increase operational complexity.

Cloud computing offers an alternative path, enabling faster deployment, scalable resources, reduced physical maintenance, and flexible pricing models.

This project evaluates:

* Cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
* Cloud deployment models (Public, Private, Colocation)
* Cloud vendor capabilities (AWS, Azure, GCP)
* Benefits, drawbacks, and migration considerations
* Stakeholder impact across business, IT, and clients

## **☁️ Cloud Service Models**

### **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**

Provides virtualized computing resources. Users manage OS, runtime, and applications while the provider manages hardware, networking, and virtualization.

### **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

Provides a managed platform for deploying applications. The provider manages the OS and runtime; users focus on code and app logic.

### **Software as a Service (SaaS)**

Provides fully managed applications accessed through a web browser. No installation or maintenance required.

---

## **🏗 Cloud Deployment Models**

### **Public Cloud**

Shared infrastructure managed by third-party providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

### **Private Cloud**

Dedicated cloud environment for a single organization. Offers greater control and security but at higher cost.

### **Colocation**

Organizations own the hardware but rent space in a professionally managed data center.

---

## **🔍 Cloud Vendor Comparison**

### **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**

**Strengths:** Broad services, global reach, mature infrastructure

**Weaknesses:** Complex pricing, steep learning curve

### **Microsoft Azure**

**Strengths:** Strong integration with Microsoft tools, hybrid cloud support

**Weaknesses:** Fewer data centers than AWS, less intuitive interface

### **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**

**Strengths:** Excellent in AI, data, and analytics; user-friendly interface

**Weaknesses:** Smaller ecosystem, fewer services, fewer global regions

---

## **⭐ Recommended Cloud Provider: AWS**

AWS is the recommended solution due to:

* Fast deployment and global availability
* Strong compliance for financial data (PCI DSS, SOC, ISO)
* Flexible pricing (pay-as-you-go and reserved instances)
* Scalable compute, storage, and database services
* Smooth support for Microsoft technologies used by the company

---

## **📈 Stakeholder Impact**

### **Business Executives**

* Faster expansion
* Reduced upfront costs
* Flexible budgeting

### **IT and Support Teams**

* Less infrastructure maintenance
* Easier monitoring and access management
* Reduced staffing needs for hardware upkeep

### **Clients and Partners**

* Improved data security
* Higher system reliability
* Faster service delivery

---

## **⚠️ Migration Challenges & Mitigation**

### **Learning Curve**

Solution: Training and AWS learning resources

### **Temporary Migration Disruptions**

Solution: Schedule migrations during low-traffic hours and maintain backups

### **Unmonitored Cloud Spending**

Solution: Use AWS Budgets and Cost Explorer for tracking and alerts
